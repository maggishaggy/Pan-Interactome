# Pan-Interactome
Functional prediction of E. coli strains and their proteins


This repository contains the scripts, both R and Python, used to construct a pan-interactome from the pan-genome of E. coli as well as protein-protein interaction data from the K12 mg1655 reference strain of E. coli. 

The JSON parser script was used to parse a JSON file from the PanX authors to create a presence/absence matrix of genes in the pan-genome.

The R script here is used to construct the pan-interactome presence/absence table.
